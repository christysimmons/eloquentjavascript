**Roads Module**

const {buildGraph} = require("./graph");

const roads = [
  "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin",
  "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall",
  "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
  "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
  "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm",
  "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop",
  "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall"
];

exports.roadGraph = buildGraph(roads.map(rte => rte.split("-")));

**Circular Dependencies**

The called modules are stored in cache. If anything is overwritten, you would see stange or unexpected results. You may see a stack overflow if there's an unbroken call loop.
